## Login, Share post React app

This is an app created with:

 Fronted --> **React JS, Tawilwinds CSS**.
 Backend --> **Firebase**.
 
* When we upload a React project to GitHub, git doesn't load the node modules folder, so when you download the repository you have to run the following command inside the folder of my repo: 

` npm i ` or ` npm install `

* if you are in linux and your're using another package manager, for  example yarn, you need to use the following command in the same folder of my repo:

` yarn install `, IDK if you can use just ` yarn i `, look that in google for yourself.
